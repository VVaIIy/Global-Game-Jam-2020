# The Calibrator Game

A quick 20-second carnival-style video game based on controlling the amount of force output by the user's hand in order to achieve the desired score. The user assumes the role of an electronics repairman commissioned to repair a scale that is not calibrated well. Unfortunately, the calibration weights are missing, but, due to years of experience, the user's character feels confident enough to calibrate the scale via muscle memory and luck. Introducing The Calibrator... All parts sold separately.
